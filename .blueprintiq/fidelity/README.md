# Fidelity Validation

This directory contains gap analysis and validation reports for architectural compliance.

## Structure

- `latest-report.json` - Most recent fidelity validation report
- `history/` - Historical validation reports with timestamps

## Fidelity Analysis

BluePrintIQ validates:
- **Component Compliance**: Implementation matches specification
- **Pattern Adherence**: Architectural patterns correctly applied
- **Integration Consistency**: Service relationships are properly implemented
- **Quality Metrics**: Performance, security, and reliability standards

## Gap Detection

Automated gap analysis identifies:
- Missing components or services
- Incorrect pattern implementations
- Broken integrations or dependencies
- Non-compliance with requirements

## Continuous Validation

Fidelity reports are generated:
- After each specification update
- During code analysis phases
- On-demand via CLI or API
- As part of CI/CD pipelines
