Test project for BluePrintIQ CLI validation

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Specifications

This project uses **BluePrintIQ** for Git-native architectural specification management.

### Directory Structure

- `specifications/` - Architectural specifications in YAML format
- `.blueprintiq/` - Project configuration and metadata

### Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Review architectural specifications in the `specifications/` directory
3. Use BluePrintIQ to generate and evolve your architecture

### Specifications

All architectural decisions and specifications are maintained as versioned YAML files in the `specifications/` directory. Each specification represents a point-in-time architectural state that can be:

- Generated from natural language conversations
- Versioned using Git
- Used to generate implementation code
- Validated for consistency and best practices
